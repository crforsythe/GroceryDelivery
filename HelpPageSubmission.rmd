- **Buy Your Own Groceries**: This refers to the traditional way you would buy your groceries at a grocery store (i.e. in-person shopping).

### Delivery Price
Each grocery delivery will cost a flat fee regardless of the number of grocery deliveries. This includes all associated costs including tip. When you buy your own groceries there is no delivery price.

### Delivery Date
Delivery will be completed today, tomorrow, in 4 days, or in 7 days. Groceries will be delivered to the given location (described below). When you buy your own groceries, you can shop any day that fits your schedule.

### Delivery Agent
Delivery will be performed by either a human or an autonomous vehicle. This will not impact the delivery price, process, or timing in any way.
